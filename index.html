            <p>
              If you can keep your head when all about you<br />&nbsp&nbsp;Are
              losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />If you can trust
              yourself when all men doubt you,<br />&nbsp&nbsp;But make
              allowance for their doubting too;<br />If you can wait and not be
              tired by waiting,<br />&nbsp&nbsp;Or being lied about don't deal
              in lies,<br />Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br />&nbsp&nbsp;And
              yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
            </p>
            <p>
              If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br />&nbsp&nbsp;If
              you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br />If you can
              meet Triumph with Disaster<br />&nbsp&nbsp;And treat those two
              imposters just the same;<br />If you can bear to hear the truth
              you've spoken<br />&nbsp&nbsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for
              fools,<br />Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />&nbsp&nbsp;And
              stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools:
            </p>
            <p>
              If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />&nbsp&nbsp;And
              risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />And lose, and start
              again at your beginnings<br />&nbsp&nbsp;And never breathe a word
              about your loss;<br />If you can force your heart and nerve and
              sinew<br />&nbsp&nbsp;To serve your turn long after they are
              gone,<br />And to so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />&nbsp&nbsp;Except
              the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'
            </p>
            <p>
              If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />&nbsp&nbsp;Or
              walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,<br />If neither foes
              nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />&nbsp&nbsp;If all men count
              with you, but none too much;<br />If you can fill the unforgiving
              minute<br />&nbsp&nbsp;With sixty seconds' worth of distance
              run,<br />Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br />&nbsp&nbsp;And
              - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!
